        <h1>Hello World, my name is Chris Ward.</h1>
        <p>I currently work as a Jr. Specialist at UCI in the Earth System Science department. Most of my work involves field work and measurements. I also do some data entry and processing. Through learning how to troubleshoot Matlab programs passed to me from previous researchers in my lab, I have developed a strong interest in programming. Particularly the process of turning thoughts and ideas into code that will then become something a user can interact with. I also really enjoy the creative aspect of constructing a program and developing syntactic awareness.</p>

        <h2>Why Web Programming?</h2>
        <p>When I realized that I should look more into this whole programming thing, I was recommended to start with Java. I had a small amount of experience with C++ previously and Java was similar syntactically to C++. I started looking into Java and watching videos, reading tutorials, learning about SDKs, etc. and realized that maybe I should jumpstart this process with something a little more approachable and could serve as a promotional tool for whatever programs I create. And so, I took a course called "Developing Websites from Scratch" and found the process intriguing. But I still wanted to learn more Back End web development. I also wanted to learn Python and more about Javascript. So the Harvard CS50 Web Programming with Python and Javascript seemed like a perfect fit.</p>
